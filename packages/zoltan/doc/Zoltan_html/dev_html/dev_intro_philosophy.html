The Zoltan load-balancing library is designed to be a general-purpose tool-kit
providing a variety of dynamic load-balancing algorithms to a wide range
of scientific applications (see the <A HREF="../ug_html/ug.html">Zoltan
User's Guide</A>). To enable general use of the library, the library does
not directly access the data structures of an application. Instead, the
library obtains information it needs to perform load balancing through
an object-oriented interface between the load-balancing library and the
application [<A HREF="dev_refs.html#HD99">Hendrickson and Devine</A>].
This interface uses call-back query functions to gather information. An
application developer must write and register these query functions before
using the load-balancing library. The intent, however, is that the number
and complexity of these query functions are low, allowing applications
to easily interface with the library. In addition, new load-balancing algorithm
development would use the same query functions as previous algorithms,
enabling applications to use new algorithms without changes to the query
functions.

<P>An example of the interaction between an application and the load-balancing
library is shown in the <A HREF="#interact figure">figure</A> below. An
application creates a load-balancing object <I>lb</I> through a call to
<B>LB_Create_Object</B>. This load-balancing object stores pointers to
registered functions and data structures for a particular instance of load
balancing. The application selects the load-balancing method for <I>lb</I>
through a call to <B>LB_Set_Method</B>. Then the application registers
the application query functions <I>user_return_coords_fn</I>, <I>user_return_num_elems_fn</I>,
and <I>user_return_elem_list_fn</I> to return the coordinates of an object,
the number of objects, and a list of objects, respectively. The application
then calls <B>LB_Balance</B> to compute a new decomposition. The load-balancing
library follows pointers to the registered functions to build the data
structures it needs to perform load balancing. It follows the <I>lb->Get_Num_Obj</I>
pointer to <I>user_return_num_elems_fn</I> to obtain the number of objects
assigned to the processor. It then follows the <I>lb->Get_Obj_List</I>
pointer to <I>user_return_elem_list_fn</I> to get a list of the objects.
For each object, it follows the <I>lb->Get_Geom</I> pointer to <I>user_return_coords_fn</I>
to get the coordinates of the object. After gathering this data, the load-balancing
library can perform the desired load balancing.

<P>In developing new load-balancing algorithms for the library, the developer
must write the code that calls the query functions to build the needed
data structures for the algorithm. However, the application need not change
its query functions. Thus, new algorithms can be added to the library and
used by an application with minimal effort on the part of the application
coder.
