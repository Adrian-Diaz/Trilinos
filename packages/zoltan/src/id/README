ID DIRECTORY -- Code for manipulating IDs that are not simple integers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  The code in this directory is not compiled into Zoltan.  It is
made obsolete by our decision to allow user-defined LB_GIDs and LB_LIDs.
I have kept it in the repository only because the code in the gr and
vx subdirectories uses these routines.  When that code is updated, these
routines can probably be removed from the DLB distribution.

id_const.h         --  Defines an ID_Struct that consists of two integers.
                       Contains prototypes for external functions that
                       manipulate these ID_Structs.  (These functions are
                       in id.c.)
id.c               --  Functions that manipulate (compare, assign, create new,
                       and print) ID_Struct values.

id_util.c          --  Currently contains no code.
id_util_const.h    --  Defines a structure of pointers to specific functions 
                       that manipulate the given ID_Struct definition.
id_util.h          --  Declares a global variable containing pointers to the
                       ID_Struct manipulation functions appropriate for the
                       defined ID_Struct.
