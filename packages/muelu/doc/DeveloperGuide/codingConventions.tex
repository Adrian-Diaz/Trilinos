\item Ensure ``const correctness" whenever possible. For example, this means using the \cc{const} keyword whenever possible
      in parameters and return values. (See the ``Const correctness" section in \cite{Cl2010} for more information.)
\item Prefer the use of \cc{int const *i} over \cc{const int *i}.  These two cases are equivalent, and mean ``\cc{i} is a pointer to
a constant integer."
