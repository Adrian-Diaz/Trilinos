\muelu supports both unit and broader testing.  Unit testing relies on the \teuchos unit-testing infrastructure\footnote{As of
October, 2010, there
doesn't seem to be any good documentation for this.  Your best bet is to look at a package already using it, such as \ifpack2.}.
Implementing new unit tests is straightforward.
\be
  \item Copy the file \cc{test/unit\_tests/Level.cpp} to a new filename of your choosing, say, \cc{foo.cpp}.
  \item Edit \cc{foo.cpp} and put in your test.
  \item Add \cc{foo.cpp} to the list of \cc{SOURCES} in file \cc{test/unit\_tests/CMakeLists.txt}.
  \item Rebuild, run the unit test executable, and you should see the new test run.
