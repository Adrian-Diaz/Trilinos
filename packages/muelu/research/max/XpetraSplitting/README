#Test.cpp: main file used to generate the executable
#	it reads a matrix and the information about mesh nodes and mesh regions
#	from two separate files. The matrix is supposed to be stored in 
#	Matrix Market format. The information about the mesh is supposed to be stored in a 
#	.txt file and it currently must respect the following layout
#
#
#        
# 		%TotalNodes	%TotalRegions
# 		6   		2
# 		Node	Region
# 		1	1
# 		2	1
# 		3	1
# 		4	1
# 		3	2
# 		4	2
# 		5	2
# 		6	2
#
#
# 	The node labels under the column named "Node" must be global indices 
# 	If a node lies on an interface between regions, then it technically belong to multiple regions
# 	and is must appear in the file as many times as the number of regins it belongs to. For each appearance it
# 	must be associated with a different region index.
#
# 	Once the information is properly imported from the file, an object of the templated class
#	Xpetra::MatrixSplitting is instantiated.
#
#
#
#Xpetra_MatrixSplitting.hpp: matrix wrapper that is supposed to store the global stiffness matrix
#	and the surrogate regional stiffness matrices once they are constructed.
#
#	The current stage of this class allows the user to work with both Epetra and Tpetra classes.
#	The specific underlying matrix library is passed as a parameter to the class Xpetra::MatrixSplitting.
#
#	Many routines of this class are unchanged with respect to the class called
#	Xpetra::CrsMatrixWrapper. However the current implementation of Xpetra::MatrixSplitting
#	does not enable inheritance directly from Xpetra::CrsMatrixWrapper. In fact, Xpetra::CrsMatrixWrapper objects 
#	are temporarily used inside the constructor of Xpetra::MatrixSplitting to store matrices. This prohibits
#	the aforementioned inheritance which would lead to a vicious cycle with consequent compile errors.
#
#	The constructor of Xpetra::MatrixSplitting calles the constructor of Xpetra::SplittingDriver to generate
#	row maps for the global maitrix and the regional stiffness matrices.
#
#
#
#Xpetra_SplittingDriver_decl.hpp: declaration of the driver class and its methods.
#	This driver takes in input the file with mesh node and region information. 
#	This information is used to create row maps for the global and the regional
#	matrices.
#
#Xpetra_SplittinDriver_def.hpp: definition of the driver class methods
